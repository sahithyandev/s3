Wireless networks are required when devices are mobile, users are nomadic and temporary connections are needed.

## Terminology

### Base Station

A wireless access point that provides connectivity to a wireless network.

### BSS
Short for Basic Service Set. The smallest building block of a WLAN. A set of stations executing same MAC protocol and competing for same shared wireless medium.

### DS

Short for Distribution System. A system used to interconnect a set of BSSs and integrated LANs to create
an extended service set (ESS).

### IBSS

Short for Independent BSS. Aka. ad hoc network. A BSS that forms a self-contained network, and in which no access to a DS is available. No infrastructure to connect to. Nodes themselves provide services. 

## Challenges

Wireless networks face more challenges compared to wired networks.

- Finding location of nodes
- Services (Addressing, Routing, etc.)
- Path loss, Fading, Interference
- Multipath propagation

### Handoff

Change of attachment from one base station to another.

### Hidden Terminal Problem

When two or more stations are within range of the base station, but not of each other. Causes them to transmit data in parallely.

## Spread spectrum

A technique used in wireless networks to transmit signals over a wider frequency band than the required minimum.

Helps reduce interference, improve resistance to eavesdropping, and enhance reliability in environments with noise and multipath effects.

### FHSS

Short for Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum. A spread spectrum technique that uses a pseudo-random sequence of frequencies to transmit data. The transmitter hops between frequencies at a high rate, making it difficult for an attacker to intercept the signal. Spreading code defines the order of frequencies that are used.

Used in Bluetooth.

### DSSS

Short for Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum. Each bit in the original signal is represented by multiple bits in the transmitted signal using a _spreading code_.

Spreading code is a pseudo-random sequence of bits. The data bits are XOR-ed by the spreading code to produce a _chip_ sequence. Received signal is de-spread by XOR-ing with the same spreading code.

Used in Wi-fi.

## CDMA

Short for Code Division Multiple Access. A channel access method used in wireless communication. Allows several transmitters to send information simultaneously over a single communication channel.

Each bit is encoded with a unique _chipping code_. Multiple signals are transmitted over the same frequency band. Receiver decodes the signal using the relevant chipping code.

## Standard

Standardized by IEEE 802.11. There are many versions of this standard such as IEEE 802.11a, IEEE 802.11b, IEEE 802.11g, IEEE 802.11n, and so on.

### Frame Structure

Frame header includes 4 addresses:
- Address 1: MAC address of the wireless receiving station
- Address 2: MAC address of the wireless transmitting station
- Address 3: MAC address of the (router) interface via which the BSS connects to other networks
- Address 4: for Ad-hoc mode of operation

## Media Access Control

### DFWMAC

Short for Distributed Foundation Wireless MAC.

Uses Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) for distributed access control and Point Coordination Function (PCF) for centralized control.

Examples:
- DCF: CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance)
- PCF: Polling by Centralized Polling Master

A logical unit of work that performs one or more database operations (reads/writes). Ensures [ACID properties](/database-systems/basics/introduction/#acid-properties). Consistency might be temporarily lost while a transaction is running. Multiple transactions can run in parallel.

## Transaction States

| State               | Description                                       | Possible Next States        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Active              | Initial state. Executing.                         | Partially Committed, Failed |
| Partially Committed | Final operation done. Waiting to commit.          | Failed, Committed           |
| Failed              | Error occurred. Cannot proceed normally.          | Aborted                     |
| Aborted             | Rolled back; database restored to previous state. | Active (if retrying)        |
| Committed           | Completed successfully.                           | -                           |

If the failure is temporary, can retry.

Explains how data is stored and managed at the physical level in a DBMS. It introduces the types of storage media, performance measures, disk organization, and techniques for efficient data access.

Revise [Mass Storage Systems - Operating Systems](/operating-systems/mass-storage-systems/) for the basics and classification of storage systems. Also [RAID](/operating-systems/raid) is covered in the lectures. They are not repeated here for the sake of brevity.

## Storage Hierarchy

Data is stored in a hierarchy of storage types with varying speed, cost, and volatility.

## Disk Block Access Optimization

Sequential blocks can be read/written faster than random blocks. Data must be organized to minimize seek and rotation delays. Fragmentation causes scattered blocks, increasing access time. Some systems periodically defragment files.

### Non-Volatile Write Buffers

Non-volatile RAM is a battery-backed RAM or flash. Acts as safe temporary storage. Speeds up writes and allows reordering to reduce arm movement.

### Log disk

Dedicated disk for sequential log writes of block updates. Write time is predictable as arm movement is minimal.

## Record Organiziation

Records can be stored in 2 ways:
- 1 file per relation
  - Heap   
    Records can be placed anywhere in the file where there is space.
  - Sequential   
    Store records in sequential order, based on the value of the search key of each record. Pointer chains used to efficiently implement insertion and deletion.
  - Hashing   
    Hashed value of some attribute specifies in which block of the file the record should be placed
- 1 file for multiple relations
  - Multitable clustering file organization   
    Records of the same relation can be linked using pointer chains. Good for cross join queries.

### Fixed-Length Records

Suppose records of fixed size ($n$) are stored in a file. Then record $i$ can be stored from $n(i-1)$.

#### Insertion

When a new record is inserted:

- Append it to the end of the file.
- Shift subsequent records down by one slot to make space; Expensive operation.
- Find a deleted record slot and reuse it.

#### Deletion

When a record is deleted:

- Move all subsequent records up by one slot; Physically removes the record.
- Moves the last record into the deleted record's slot; Reduces movement but changes record order.
- Mark it as deleted; Add the record slot to a free list for reuse.

### Variable-Length Records

Variable-length records are more common in DBMSs due to variable length fields and multiple record types in a single file.

Attributes are stored in order. Variable length attributes are represented using an offset and length. The actual values would be placed after all fixed-length attributes. Null values are represented by null-value bitmap.

#### Slotted Page Structure

A way to organize variable-length records inside a single disk block. Allows database efficiently insert, delete, and move records without breaking references.

Each page has two main parts:

- Header — contains:
  - Number of records.
  - Pointer to end of free space.
  - Table of _slots_ — each slot stores the _offset and length_ of a record.

- Data area — where actual records are stored, packed from the end of the page backward.

New records are added at the end of free space; a new slot entry is created in the header.
When a record is deleted, its slot is marked empty; space may be reused later.
If a record moves (e.g., due to compaction), only the slot’s pointer changes, not any external references. so record IDs remain valid.

## Buffer
Portion of main memory available to store copies of disk blocks.

### Buffer Manager

Subsystem responsible for allocating buffer space in main memory.

Programs call on the buffer manager when they need a block
from disk. If the block is already in the buffer, buffer manager returns its address in main memory. If not, buffer manager:
- Allocates space in the buffer for the block.   
  If space is not available, another block is written to disk and evicted.
- Reads the block from the disk to the buffer, and returns the address of the block in main memory to requester.

### Buffer Replacement Policies

Most operating systems replace the block using Least Recently Used (LRU) strategy. But in RDBMSs, LRU other strategies are also used:
- Pinned block – memory block that is not allowed to be written
back to disk.
- Toss-immediate strategy – frees the space occupied by a block
as soon as the final tuple of that block has been processed
- Most recently used (MRU) strategy – system must pin the
block currently being processed. After the final tuple of that block
has been processed, the block is unpinned, and it becomes the
most recently used block.

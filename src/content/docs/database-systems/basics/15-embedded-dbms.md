Refers to a DBMS tightly integrated with an application. Operates inside the application and is usually invisible to the user.

Used in: mobile apps, IoT systems, industrial devices, and embedded controllers.

### Characteristics

- Hidden from end-user.
- Minimal or no maintenance.
- No dedicated Database Administrator (DBA).
- Supports in-memory or on-disk modes.
- Fast access: Local access within the application.
- Low total cost of ownership (TCO).

## Design Concerns

- APIs: SQL, native, or proprietary interfaces.
- Architectures: Lightly or deeply embedded.
- Storage modes: In-memory, on-disk, or hybrid.
- Database types: Relational, object-oriented, key-value, or EAV models.
- Target markets: mobile, real-time, or resource-limited devices.

## Characteristics

- Integrated into host applications.
- Often embedded through scripting (e.g., Python, Java).
- Lightweight and low-cost.
- May not scale well for large systems.
- Transaction control is supported.
- Limited text search or SQL support.

## Architectures

### Client–Server Architecture

The traditional one. Database server is a separate process. Clients connect via network (JDBC, ODBC, etc.). Multiple clients can access simultaneously. Requires installation, setup, and maintenance.

### Lightly Embedded Architecture

Database engine installed with the application. Resides on the same machine. Small footprint, nearly full features. Can be accessed by multiple apps.

### Deeply Embedded Architecture

Database runs inside the application process. No external database engine. Distributed easily as a library file. Popular in mobile apps. Ideal for offline and single-user environments.

## Examples

| Database                | Language | Key Traits                       | Notes                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| HSQLDB (Hypersonic SQL) | Java     | In-memory or on-disk             | Lightweight, useful for demos          |
| Apache Derby            | Java     | Embedded or client-server mode   | Included in Java EE (Java DB)          |
| SQLite                  | C        | ~350 KB. Embedded in Android     | Most used embedded DB                  |
| Berkeley DB             | C, Java  | Library-based, no SQL layer      | Extremely fast; used in LDAP, Sendmail |
| InterBase               | C++      | Works in server or embedded mode | Supports encryption, SQL, JDBC, ODBC   |

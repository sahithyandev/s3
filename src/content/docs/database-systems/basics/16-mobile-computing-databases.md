Mobiles operates in environments with wireless communication, limited bandwidth, and intermittent connectivity.

Consists of:
- Mobile hosts: laptops, phones, or tablets.
- Wired hosts: servers or fixed systems.
- Communication network: Wi-Fi, 4G, 5G, Bluetooth.

Communication can either be:
- Through [base stations](/data-communication-and-networking/mobile-telecom/#base-station)
- Direct host-to-host

### Database Issues

Applications which rely on a database must handle:

- Query optimization: minimize data transferred and network cost.
- Energy consumption: transmission uses more energy than receiving.
- Location services: queries depend on device location.
- Data broadcast: base stations broadcast shared data.
- Disconnection: must maintain cached local data and sync later.
- Consistency: local copies can become outdated.

## Routing and Query Processing

Optimization balances:

- User time: query response delay.
- Communication cost: data transfer charges.
- Energy: minimize transmission usage. Reception requires much less energy than transmission.
- Timing: off-peak vs peak network costs.

## Data Broadcast

- Base station broadcasts frequently accessed data.
- Clients listen instead of sending requests → saves power.
- Supports devices without transmit capability.
- Broadcasts can be scheduled (fixed or adaptive).
- Noise or signal loss handled by redundancy (parity bits).

## Disconnectivity and Consistency

When devices are offline:

- Local updates may conflict when reconnecting.
- Cached data may become stale.

Challenges:

- Recoverability: updates may be lost.
- Consistency: local data may not match server state.

## Mobile Updates

- If only one host updates → simple sync.
- If multiple hosts update → conflicts occur.
- Version numbering used to track document versions.
- Sometimes manual reconciliation is required.

## Detecting Inconsistent Updates — Version Vector Scheme

Each host maintains a version vector per document.

For host `i` and document `d`:

- `Vd,i[k]` = version number of `d` at host `k` known to `i`.

Rules:

If all vectors equal → copies are identical.
If all `Vd,i[k] ≤ Vd,j[k]` and not equal → `i`’s copy is older.
If some elements are higher/lower on both sides → inconsistent copies (conflict).

Used in distributed and mobile systems to detect divergence.

## Handling Inconsistent Updates

- Automatic merge is complex.
- Manual resolution often needed.
- Applied in mobile DBs and distributed file systems.
- Works if inconsistencies are rare or predictable.

## Commercial Embedded Databases (Oracle)

Oracle offers several embedded database products for different scenarios.

### TimesTen

- In-memory RDBMS for real-time, high-throughput applications.
- Used in telecom, finance, and CRM.
- Can serve as standalone DB or cache for Oracle DB.
- Features replication and high availability.

| Feature       | Oracle 10g    | TimesTen         |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Optimization  | Disk-centric  | Memory-centric   |
| Deployment    | Database tier | Application tier |
| Response time | ms            | µs               |
| Data capacity | TBs           | GBs              |

### Berkeley DB

- Open-source, high-performance embedded key–value store.
- No SQL layer; accessed via API.
- Runs in-process with the application.
- Used by Amazon as a high-speed cache in front of Oracle Database.

Key features:

- ACID transactions.
- Low latency and high throughput.
- Minimal hardware requirements.

### Oracle Database Lite

- Designed for mobile and field-force environments.
- Provides secure offline access and syncs when connected.
- Synchronization: async, event-driven, conflict-aware.
- Supports automatic reconciliation and device management.

Architecture:

- Embedded client DB + Mobile server for sync and provisioning.
- Sync uses In-Queue (upload) and Out-Queue (download) model.

## Summary

- Embedded databases run inside applications, require no DBA, and have small footprints.
- Two architectures: lightly embedded (external engine) and deeply embedded (in-process).
- Mobile databases face challenges with energy, connectivity, and consistency.
- Version vectors help detect conflicts after disconnections.
- Oracle’s embedded solutions—TimesTen, Berkeley DB, and Database Lite—illustrate different deployment and synchronization models.

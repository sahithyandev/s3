Refers to datasets that are too large, fast, or complex for traditional databases to manage efficiently.

### Characteristics

- Volume: in the scale of terabytes or petabytes.
- Velocity: high ingest/update rates and need for low-latency ingestion or real-time processing.
- Variety: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data (logs, JSON, images, time series).
- Veracity: data quality and trustworthiness issues at scale.
- Value: extracting meaningful analytics or driving applications from the data.

## Big Data Storage Systems

### Distributed File Systems (DFS)

Stores data across many machines. Offers a single logical view. Provides redundancy via replication to handle failures.

Example: Google FS, Hadoop HDFS.

Hadoop HDFS features:

- NameNode: stores metadata (file → block mapping).
- DataNode: stores actual block data.
- Block size: typically 64 MB.
- Write-once-read-many model.

### Sharding

Partitions data using a shard key.
Improves scalability but adds complexity:

- Application must route queries manually.
- Rebalancing shards is difficult.
- Increases failure points → more replicas needed.

## Parallel & Distributed Databases

Use multiple nodes to run queries in parallel. When data is stored on multiple nodes, replication ensures availability.

### MapReduce

Programming model for large-scale parallel computation. Allows fault-tolerant processing of data.  

- `map()` – transforms input into key–value pairs.
- `reduce()` – aggregates values by key.

## Algebraic Operations & Spark

- Modern systems (Spark, Tez) extend MapReduce with **relational-like operations**.
- **RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset)**: fault-tolerant, distributed data abstraction.
- Supports transformations like map, filter, reduce, join.

## Streaming Data

- Continuous data flow (stocks, sensors, IoT).
- **Queries on streams** use **windows** (time/tuple-based).
- **Window types:**
  - Tumbling (non-overlapping)
  - Hopping (fixed-size overlap)
  - Sliding (moving window)
  - Session (per user session)

### Architectures

- **Lambda architecture:** stream + batch layers for processing.
- **Pub-Sub systems:** e.g., **Apache Kafka** for topic-based streaming.

## 11. Graph Data Model

- Represents entities and their relationships as nodes and edges.
- Equivalent to ER model in structure.
- **Graph Databases:** e.g., Neo4J.
  - Enable efficient edge traversal queries.
  - Use languages like **Cypher** for pattern-based queries.

The process of converting a high-level query into an efficient execution plan that retrieves the required data from storage.

### Execution Plan

Annotated expression specifying detailed evaluation strategy. Defines exactly what algorithm is used for each
operation, and how the execution of the operations is coordinated.

## Parsing and Translation

SQL query is parsed into an internal representation. Then converted into relational algebra form. Syntax and schema (table/attribute names) are verified.

## Optimization

Multiple equivalent algebraic expressions exist. DBMS finds the most efficient strategy for executing a query among many logically equivalent alternatives.

Example:

```math
σ_{\text{balance}<2500}(π_\text{balance}(\text{account}))
≡ π_{\text{balance}}(σ_{\text{balance}<2500}(\text{account}))
```

Cost estimation is done using statistics from the database catalog such as:

- Number of tuples.
- Size of tuples.
- Distinct values in attributes.
- Expected size of intermediate results.

### Measures of Query Cost

Generally the total time to answer query.

Factors:

- Disk I/O (dominant factor)   
  Write cost is higher than read cost. Because of verification after write.
- CPU
- Network delay (in distributed systems)

Estimated as:

```math
\text{Cost} = (\text{Seeks} × \text{SeekCost}) + (\text{BlocksRead} × \text{ReadCost}) + (\text{BlocksWritten} × \text{WriteCost})
```

## Evaluation

The query execution engine runs the chosen plan. Produces the result to the user or application.

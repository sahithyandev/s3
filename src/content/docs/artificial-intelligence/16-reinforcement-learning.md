The process of _learning_ to maximize expected rewards. Feedback is given in the form of _rewards_. Agent's utility is defined by the reward function. All learning is based on observed samples of outcomes.

Builds on MDPs. Here, transition function and reward function are unknown.

## Model-Based Learning

Based on observations through multiple episodes, the agent learns the transition and reward functions.

## Model-Free Learning

An agent learns directly from its interactions with the environment.

### Passive RL

An agent observes another agent's actions and rewards. And learns from the observed outcomes.

### Active RL

An agent takes actions and receives rewards. And learns from the outcomes.

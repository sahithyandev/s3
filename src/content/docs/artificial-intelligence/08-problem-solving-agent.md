A form of goal-based agents. An agent that plans ahead. Considers a sequence of actions that form a path to a goal state. Uses atomic representation. May or may not be optimal.

Usually designed for simple environments: single-agent, episodic, fully observable, static, discrete, and deterministic.

### Searching

The computational process undertaken by a problem-solving agent.

## Process

The thinking process of a problem-solving agent.

### Goal formulation

Goals are what needs to be achieved. 

### Problem formulation

The agent specifies:
- current state
- possible actions
- goal test
- transitions

### Search

The agent simulates sequences of actions in its model until it finds a sequence of actions that reaches the goal (solution).

### Execution

The agent executes the actions in-order.

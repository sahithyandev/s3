A graph with the following:

- Nodes: Set of random variables
- Directed links: The intuitive meaning of a link from node X to node Y is that X has a direct influence on Y
- Each node has a conditional probability table (CPT) that quantifies the effects that the parent have on the node.
- The graph has no directed cycles (DAG)

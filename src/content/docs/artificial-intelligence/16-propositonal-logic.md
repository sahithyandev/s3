Less ontological commitment. Weak epistemological commitment.

### Syntax

Sentences are formed using logical connectives such as not, and.

- Atomic sentence: a single proposition (e.g., $P$).
- Literal: an atomic sentence or its negation.
- Complex sentence: built from simpler ones with connectives.

### Semantics

Defines the truth of sentences under a model (assignment of true/false values).

Example: $m1 = \set{P = \text{true}, Q = \text{true}, R = \text{false}}$

## Conjunctive Normal Form

Aka. CNF. A standard way of writing logical formulas so that they can be easily processed by reasoning algorithms like resolution.

A formula is in CNF **iff**:
- it’s a conjunction ($\land$) **and**
- each clause inside the conjunction is a disjunction ($\lor$) of literals

### Steps

- Eliminate biconditionals ($\iff$)   
   Replace: $(A \iff B) \to  (A \implies B) \land (B \implies A)$

- Eliminate implications ($\implies$)   
   Replace: $(A \implies B)  \to  \lnot A \lor B$

- Move lnot inwards using De Morgan’s laws   
   - $\lnot(A \land B) \to (\lnot A \lor \lnot B)$
   - $\lnot(A \lor B) \to (\lnot A \land \lnot B)$
   - $\lnot(\lnot A) \to A$

- Apply distributive law to get a conjunction of disjunctions    
   $(A \lor (B \land C)) \to (A \lor B) \land (A \lor C)$

- Simplify   
   Remove duplicate literals or clauses if possible.

A subsystem that manages communication between the system and external devices. OS abstracts hardware details, coordinates access, and ensures controlled sharing of I/O resources among users and applications.

### Device Driver

A small software component that abstracts hardware specifics and provide a uniform device-access interface to the OS. Act as the software interface between the I/O subsystem and hardware devices.

### Device Controller

A hardware component that manages the communication between the CPU and a specific type of I/O device. Translates high-level commands from the OS into low-level signals that the device can understand.

### Device Status Table

Contains entry for each I/O device.

## Synchronous vs. Asynchronous

When the I/O related system call returns.

### Synchronous

I/O syscall returns only when the operation is done. Process has to wait until I/O operation completes.

### Asynchronous

I/O syscall returns immediately. Operation continues in background. Program does not have to wait for the result at the time of the call. Completion is reported later. More efficient than synchronous I/O.

## Blocking vs. Non-Blocking

Whether the thread sleeps or stays runnable during the wait.

### Blocking

Thread is put to sleep until operation completes. No CPU usage while waiting.

### Non-Blocking

The I/O call returns immediately. If the operation cannot proceed (e.g., no data available), the call returns an error/status code instead of putting the thread to sleep.

## I/O Hardware

### Port

A connection point through which an I/O device communicates with the CPU. Represents a specific hardware address(es) for a device. Not to be confused with the physical ports such as USB port.

CPU reads/writes data to the port using special instructions (e.g., IN, OUT).

Can either be:

- Serial - one bit at a time (e.g., keyboard, mouse)
- Parallel - multiple bits at a time (e.g., printer)

### Bus

Shared communication path amount system components.

- Data bus: carries actual data.
- Address bus: carries device or memory addresses.
- Control bus: carries control signals (read/write, interrupt, etc.).

Can be system-wide (like PCI, USB) or dedicated to devices.

Example:

- PCI: system-wide; connects CPU, memory, and disk controller.
- USB: system-wide; connects multiple peripherals like a keyboard and webcam.

### Controller

Aka. host adapter. A hardware interface (chip) that controls communication between the CPU/bus and a specific device.

Interprets CPU commands and controls the device’s hardware signals. May include data buffers, control registers, and logic for error handling. Each device has its own controller.

Registers: Used for communication between the driver and device.

- Data-in Register – Holds data from the device.
- Data-out Register – Holds data to send to the device.
- Status Register – Contains device status information.
- Control Register – Receives commands from the driver.

## Communication Mechanisms

3 different mechanisms by which the I/O devices communicate with the system.

### Polling

Aka. busy-wait. CPU repeatedly checks the device’s status register until it becomes ready. Efficient for fast devices; wasteful for slow ones. CPU-driven method.

Steps:

1. Host checks the busy bit until 0.
2. Host sets command-ready bit to start transfer.
3. Controller performs operation and clears bits.

### Interrupt-Driven

Explained on [its own page](/operating-systems/interrupt-driven-io). 

### Direct Memory Access

Device controller transfers blocks of data directly between memory and device controller's internal buffer. Only 1 interrupt per block; not per byte. Used by high-speed I/O devices.
Improves efficiency.

Steps:

1. OS writes a command block (source, destination, count) into memory.
2. DMA controller takes control of the bus (cycle stealing).
3. Only one interrupt per block (vs. per byte).

## I/O Latency

Total time from interrupt arrival to completion of I/O operation. Higher latency is undesirable.

### Interrupt Latency

Time from interrupt arrival to start of ISR.

## Application I/O Interface

### Device Categories

Block Devices: (e.g., Disk) → Read, Write, Seek; typically use DMA.
Character Devices: (e.g., Keyboard, Mouse) → Get(), Put().
Network Devices: Managed via sockets.

### STREAMS

A full-duplex communication channel (Unix System V).
Consists of:

- STREAM Head: User interface.
- Driver End: Device interface.
- Intermediate Modules: Optional processing layers.

## Kernel I/O Subsystem

### Services

Buffering: Temporary data storage to handle speed/size mismatches.

Caching: Stores frequently used data for faster access.
Spooling: Queues output for single-access devices (e.g., printers).

### Double Buffering

Using two buffers: user & kernel. All I/O operations are done using kernel-managed buffer first. Then results will be copied to the process' memory block. Adds overhead.

### Management

Scheduling: Orders I/O requests (may apply fairness or QoS).
Device Reservation: Allocates exclusive device access; risk of deadlock.
Protection: All I/O instructions are privileged; user I/O via system calls.
Power Management: Controls device power states using techniques like

Component-level control,
Wake locks,
Power collapse (deep sleep).

## I/O Performance

### Factors

CPU time used for drivers and kernel routines.
Context switches due to interrupts.
Data copying overhead.

### Optimization Strategies

Reduce context switches and data copying.
Reduce interrupts via large transfers or intelligent controllers.
Use DMA for block transfers.
Balance CPU, memory, and I/O performance.

- Programmed I/O   
  The CPU is responsible for checking the status of an I/O device and transferring data. This method is simple but inefficient, as the CPU spends time waiting for the device to be ready.
- Interrupt-driven I/O   
  The CPU initiates an I/O operation and continues executing other instructions. When the I/O device is ready, it sends an interrupt signal to the CPU, which temporarily halts its current task to handle the I/O operation. This improves efficiency by allowing the CPU to perform other work instead of waiting.
- Direct Memory Access (DMA)   
  A special controller manages data transfer between memory and I/O devices, freeing the CPU from involvement in the actual data transfer.

Operating systems are interrupt-driven. Because this approach allows the CPU to respond quickly to important events (such as I/O completion, hardware failures, or user actions) without constantly checking the status of devices.

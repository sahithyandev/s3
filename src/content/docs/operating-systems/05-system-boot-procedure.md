The sequence of steps a computer performs from being powered on until the operating system becomes ready to run user programs.

## Power-On Self Test

Aka. POST. A firmware-level diagnostic routine. Checks whether basic hardware is working
(memory, CPU, keyboard interface, simple buses). If POST fails, system halts or shows an error.

:::note[Fun Fact]

Keyboard is considered essential and checked during POST. But mouse is not.

## Firmware Stage

Can either be BIOS or UEFI. Firmware performs:

- Hardware initialization
- Device discovery
- Locating the next-stage bootloader
- Loads bootloader into memory

### BIOS

Short for Basic Input/Output System. Traditional firmware providing hardware initialization and the old-style bootloader interface.

### UEFI

Short for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface. Modern replacement with better drivers, secure booting, and support for large disks.

## Bootloader Stage

Bootloader is a small program that prepares the system to load the operating system kernel.

Role of the bootloader:

- Provide a menu of OS installations (multiboot)
- Load the kernel into RAM
- Provide kernel parameters (optional)
- Switch the CPU to the proper mode
- Finally jumps to the kernel entry point, transferring control.

Examples: GRUB, LILO, Windows Boot Manager, systemd-boot.

## Kernel Initialization

Kernel initilization involves:

- Sets up [interrupt handlers](/operating-systems/interrupt-driven-io/#interrupt)
- Initializes memory management
- Detects and initializes [device drivers](/operating-systems/io-system/#device-driver)
- Mounts the root filesystem

Once the kernel finishes its internal setup, it starts the first user-space process.

## Init System / User Space Start

Init system is the very first user-space process started by the kernel. Responsible for launching all other system services.

Init performs:

- Starting system services (networking, logging, daemons)
- Creating the user environment
- Starting login managers or shells

At this point, the system is fully booted and ready for user programs.

Examples: `systemd`, `SysVinit`, `OpenRC`.

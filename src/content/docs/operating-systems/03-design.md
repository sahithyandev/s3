Design of an OS depends on a lot of things, and a lot of variations exist. Some important design aspects are discussed below.

Factors affecting the design of OS:
- [Computer system architecture](/computer-architecture/introduction#computer-system-architecture)
- [Computing environment](#computing-environment)
- [Goals](#goals)
- [Expected services](/services)

### Policy

Defines what needs to be done.

### Mechanism

Defines how something is done at the low-level implementation.

Examples:

- CPU Scheduling
  - Mechanism: The context-switch routine that saves/restores registers.
  - Policy: Which process to run next (FCFS, Round Robin, Priority).
- Memory Management
  - Mechanism: Page table structures, page replacement hooks.
  - Policy: Which page replacement strategy (LRU, FIFO).
- I/O
  - Mechanism: Device driver interface to queues requests.
  - Policy: Which request to serve first (SCAN, SSTF).-

## Computing Environments

### Traditional

Standalone computers, networked nowadays.

### Mobile

Smartphones/tablets with sensors and wireless networks.

### Client-Server

Servers respond to client requests.

### Peer-to-Peer

All nodes act as both client and server.

### Cloud Computing

Computing delivered as services (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS).
Uses virtualization heavily.

### Real-Time Embedded

Perform tasks within strict timing constraints (automotive, medical).
  
## Goals

### User Goals

Characteristics of an OS expected by a user.

Examples: easy to use, fast, safe.

### System Goals

Characteristics of an OS expected by its developers.

Examples: easy to design, maintain, reliable.

## Implementation Languages

A system goal. Usually kernel is implemented using a language that is closer to the hardware. Examples: C and assembly. System programs are built using C, C++ or scripting languages.

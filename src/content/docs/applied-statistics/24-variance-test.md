Used to compare the variability (spread) of two populations.

It checks whether the two population variances are equal or significantly different.

Typical use:
• To test the assumption of equal variances before applying a pooled t-test.
• To check if two machines, processes, or samples have similar consistency.

### Hypotheses Setup

Let

```math
\sigma_1^2 = \text{variance of population 1}
\quad , \quad
\sigma_2^2 = \text{variance of population 2}
```

Then:

```math
H_0 : \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2
```

Alternative hypothesis depends on the problem:

```math
H_1 : \sigma_1^2 \ne \sigma_2^2  \quad \text{(two-tailed)}
```

```math
H_1 : \sigma_1^2 > \sigma_2^2  \quad \text{(right-tailed)}
```

```math
H_1 : \sigma_1^2 < \sigma_2^2  \quad \text{(left-tailed)}
```

## Test Statistic

When $\mu$ is unknown, $\bar{x}$ is used as an estimate.

When sample size is small ($n \lt 30$):

```math
s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^2
```

When sample is large:

```math
s^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^2
```

The test statistic is:

|                  | Small Sample                                  | Large Sample                              |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| $\mu$ is known   | $\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma^2} \sim \chi^2_n$     | $\frac{ns^2}{\sigma^2} \sim \chi^2_n$     |
| $\mu$ is unknown | $\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma^2} \sim \chi^2_{n-1}$ | $\frac{ns^2}{\sigma^2} \sim \chi^2_{n-1}$ |

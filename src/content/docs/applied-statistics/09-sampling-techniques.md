Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals or items from a population to make statistical inferences about the whole. It helps researchers study large populations efficiently without examining every individual.

### Advantages

- Feasibility – Studying an entire population is often impossible due to size or accessibility.
- Economy – Sampling reduces cost by limiting the number of observations.
- Speed – Results can be obtained faster than a census.
- Accuracy – Quick collection helps maintain data relevance and reliability.
- Conservation of Resources – Prevents exhausting data sources during measurement.

### Disadvantages

- If sampling is biased, or not representative, or too
  small, the conclusion may not be valid and reliable.
- In research, the respondents to a study must have a
  common characteristics which is the basis of the
  study.
- If the population is very large and there are many
  sections and subsections, the sampling procedure
  becomes very complicated.
- If the researcher does not possess the necessary skill
  and technical knowhow in sampling procedure.

### A Good Sample

A good sample must ensure both:

- accuracy: no bias
- precision: sample represents the population

## Population

### Hetrogenous

A population with diverse characteristics or attributes among its members.

## Hidden

For groups difficult to access:

- Use mixed sampling methods (snowball + purposive).
- Maintain confidentiality and anonymity.
- Gain community trust before data collection.

## Types

## Probability Sampling Methods

Every unit in the population has a known, non-zero chance of being selected.

### Simple Random Sampling

Equal chance for all elements. With or without replacement.

### Systematic Sampling

From a population of $N$ and a sample size of $n$, select an item randomly in the first $n$ items, and then every $k$th item after it.

Here $k=\frac{N}{n}$ is the sampling interval.

Simple to execute. Evenly spread samples.

Can be biased if hidden periodicity exists.

### Stratified Sampling

Population is divided into _strata_ (groups) based on shared characteristics. Inside each stratum, simple random sampling is performed and the results are combined.

Ensures representation of all groups. Provides greater accuracy when population is heterogeneous.

### Cluster Sampling

Population divided into _clusters_. Each represnets a mini-population. Randomly select some clusters, and include all members within selected clusters.

Cost-effective for large geographic areas.

Less precise; may require larger sample to maintain accuracy.

## Non-Probability Sampling Methods

Units are chosen based on subjective judgment, convenience, or accessibility.

### Quota Sampling

Population divided into categories. Fixed number of elements of each category is surveyed.

May introduce bias.

### Judgement Sampling

Aka. Purposive Sampling. Researcher selects sample based on knowledge or purpose. Used when expert choice is justified.

### Convenience Sampling

Sample selected from easily available respondents. Quick but highly biased.

### Snowball Sampling

Existing study subjects recruit future subjects from among their acquaintances. Useful for hidden populations.

### Self-Selection Sampling

Individuals voluntarily participate. Not diverse. Biased.

## Advanced / Repeated Sampling Designs

### Theoretical Sampling

Drawn to test specific hypotheses or theoretical ideas. Common in grounded theory research.

### Repeat Sampling

Entire sampling process repeated at intervals (e.g., periodic surveys). Different samples at each iteration. Allows observation of changes over time but requires large samples.

### Panel Surveys

Aka. Cohort Surveys. Same group studied repeatedly over long periods (_longitudinal studies_). Issues: fatigue, attrition, and order effects.

### Rotating Survey

Sample is split into rotation groups. In each iteration, one rotation group is replaced with another. Mix of repeat and panel survey.

## Sampling Design Process

Below components must be defined before sampling:

- Target Population
- Parameter of Interest
- Sampling Frame: list or source of all population elements.
- Sampling Method
- Sample Size

## Nonresponse Issues

Nonresponse occurs when selected subjects do not provide data.

Can be caused by:
- Refusal to respond
- Ineligibility
- Inability to locate respondent or contact

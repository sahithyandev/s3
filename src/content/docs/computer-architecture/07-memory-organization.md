Memory is very slow compared to CPU. To bridge the performance gap between the 2, a memory hierarchy which includes, different levels of memory is used.

## Cache

Small amount of memory, ranging from a few KBs to MBs. Built using SRAM. Slower than registers but faster than main memory. Used to store frequently accessed data. A transparent speedup mechanism; performance increases even though the program instructions remain unchanged.

### Cache block

Minimum unit of data that is transferred between cache and main memory. Tagged with memory address. Searched in parallel. A cache block stores data, tag for the memory address and some other metadata.

Multiple blocks are moved between levels in cache hierarchy.

### Hit ratio

Fraction of memory accesses found in cache.

### Hit time

Time to access a block in cache.

### Cache miss

When required item is not found in cache.

3 types:
- Compulsory: 1st access to a block
- Capacity: limited cache capacity force blocks to be removed from a cache & later retrieved
- Conflict (collision)â€“ multiple blocks compete for the same set/block

### Miss ratio

Fraction of memory accesses not found in cache.

### Miss penalty

Time to bring a block from memory plus deliver it to processor.

:::note

```math
\text{Average memory access time} = \text{Hit time} + \text{Miss rate} \times \text{Miss penalty}
```

## Cache Organization

Memory is divided into _blocks_ (aka. _lines_) to be stored in cache.

### Memory address split

A memory address is split into tag, index, and offset.
- Offset   
  Selects the word within a block. If block size is 64 bytes, least significant 6 bits are used to address each word. 
- Index  
  Index of the set. If the total number of sets are $2^n$, then $n$ bits are used here.
- Tag   
  Identifies which memory block is stored in the that set's line. Remaining bits are index and offset.
  
### Cache Entry Table

A small table is used to record cache entries. The table stores:
- tag
- index
- valid bit (1 bit)

### Associativity

Defines where blocks can be placed in a cache.
- Fully associative: no sets, blocks can be placed anywhere
- N-way set associative: blocks are placed in sets, each set has multiple blocks
- Direct mapped: each block is placed in a unique set (special case of N-way set associative where $N=1$)

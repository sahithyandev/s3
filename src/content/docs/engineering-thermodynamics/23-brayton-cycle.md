Ideal cycle for gas turbines. Open cycle. Named after George Brayton.

The cycle is converted to a close cycle using a heat exchanger (aka. heat recovery steam generator).

### Processes

1 → 2: isentropic compression (compressor)
2 → 3: constant-pressure heat addition (combustor)
3 → 4: isentropic expansion (turbine)
4 → 1: constant-pressure heat rejection

### Pressure Ratio

```math
r_p = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
```

### Efficiency

```math
\eta = 1 - \frac{1}{r_p^{1 - \frac{1}{k}}}
```

### Back-Work Ratio

```math
BWR = \frac{W_\text{comp}}{W_\text{turb}} = \frac{W_\text{in}}{W_\text{out}}
```

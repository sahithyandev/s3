Region of space, enclosed by a boundary.

- Open system: Mass, energy transfer is possible. Aka. control volume.
- Closed system: Energy transfer is possible, mass transfer is not possible
- Isolated system: Energy and mass transfer are not possible

### Boundary

Can be imaginary or physical. Boundary can be flexible.

### Surroundings

Everything outside the system.

## Properties

Aka. point functions. Explains the state of the system.

### Intrinsic properties

Do not depend on the size of the system. Examples:
- temperature
- pressure
- specific heat capacity

### Extensive properties

Depend on the size of the system. Examples:
- mass
- volume
- internal energy
- entropy
- enthalpy
- heat capacity

### Specific properties

Mass-normalized properties. Intrinsic properties. Prefixed with "specific". Lowercase alphabets are used to denote these. 

Examples:
- specific heat capacity
- specific entropy
- specific enthalpy
- specific volume
- specific internal energy
- specific entropy
- specific enthalpy
- specific heat capacity

## State

An instance of the system. Defined by its properties.

If a system is free from gravitational, magnetic, surface tension effects, etc, only 2 independent properties are needed to define the state.

## Thermodynamic equilibrium

A state of a system that experiences no change.

Mechanical, phase, chemical, thermal equilibriums are required for thermodynamic equilibrium.

## Thermodynamic process

A change in the state of a system.

A thermodynamic cycle is series of thermodynamic processes that returns the system to its initial state.

### Isothermal process

System temperature remains constant.

### Adiabatic process

No heat transfer. 

### Isobaric process

System pressure remains constant.

###  Isochoric process

System volume remains constant.

### Polytropic process

System pressure and volume are related by a power law.

### Quasi-equilibrium process

System is in equilibrium throughout the process.

### Reversible process

A thermodynamic process that can be reversed without any trace on the surrounding. Ideal case.

### Irreversible process

A thermodynamic process that cannot be reversed without any trace on the surrounding.

### Steady flow process

A thermodynamic process in which, at any fixed point, they remain the same during the entire process.

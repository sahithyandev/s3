2 major application domains of engineering thermodynamics:
- power generation   
  thermal power generation such as coal power plants, nuclear power plants, natural gas power plants, geothermal solar thermal and combined heating and power applications (CHP systems).
- refrigeration amd heat pumps   
  From simple domestic level refrigerator or air conditioner to a large scale industrial refrigeration systems and AC systems. Heat pumps also vary from small domestic scale heat pumps to very large scale industrial heat pumps.
 
 ### CHP system
 
Short for Combined Heat and Power systems. Power and heat are produced simultaneously.

Examples:
- Gasoline or diesel engines
- Jet propulsion systems


that heat may be for process heating or it could be for district heating. In addition to these electrical power generation applications, we can't  generation systems like internal combustion engines.

These are considered as heat engines because they convert heat into work. They are operating in thermodynamic cycles. 

## Power cycle

The thermodynamic cycles that modeled the operation of these power generation applications.

2 types:
- Vapor power cycle
- Gas power cycle

Practically very complex. Assumptions are made to simplify the analysis. Carnot cycle is the perfect theoretical cycle, which is the upper limit for operation. Ideal thermodynamic cycle lies in between the practical and the Carnot cycle and it is much closer to the practical operation.

### Vapor power cycle

The working fluid experiences phase transition between liquid and gas.

Most used one is steam cycle, which is used in steam power plants.

### Gas power cycle
The working fluid is in the gaseous phase.

Used in gas turbines, IC engines and jet propulsion.

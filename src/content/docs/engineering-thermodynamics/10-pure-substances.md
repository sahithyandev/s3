A substance that has a fixed chemical composition throughout its mass. A mixture of 2 or more phases of a pure substance is also a pure substance. Homogenous substance is also a pure substance.

Substances exist in different phases, such as solid, liquid, and gas. Sometimes there are multiple phases within a principle phase.

### Solid

Molecules are arranged in 3-dimensional pattern. Molecular attraction is strong. Molecules stay at fixed positions. Molecules cannot move relative to each other, they continually oscillate.

### Liquid

Molecules rotate and translate freely. Intermolecular forces are weaker relative to solids.

### Gas

Intermolecular distances are high. Intermolecular forces are very weak. Molecules move at random. Molecules in higher energy level than they are in the liquid or solid phases.

## Phase Diagram

A graphical representation of the conditions under which a substance exists in a each phase.
- Fusion line   
  The boundary on a phase diagram that separates the solid and liquid phases. Represents the conditions (temperature and pressure) at which a substance melts or freezes.
- Evaporation line   
  The boundary that separates the liquid and gas phases; it shows the conditions under which a substance boils or condenses.
- Sublimation line   
  The boundary between the solid and gas phases; it indicates the conditions where a substance changes directly from solid to gas or vice versa, without passing through the liquid phase.
- Critical line   
  The line that ends at the critical point, beyond which the liquid and gas phases become indistinguishable; it represents the highest temperature and pressure at which a liquid and its vapor can coexist.
- Critical point   
  The unique set of temperature and pressure at which a substance exists as a supercritical fluid, where the distinction between liquid and gas phases disappears.
- Triple point   
  The unique set of temperature and pressure at which all three phases (solid, liquid, and gas) of a substance coexist in equilibrium.

## Phase Changing

Happens due to changes in temperature or pressure. The main phase change processes are:

- Melting (Fusion): Transition from solid to liquid when heat is added at constant pressure.
- Freezing: Transition from liquid to solid when heat is removed.
- Vaporization (Boiling/Evaporation): Transition from liquid to gas when heat is added.
- Condensation: Transition from gas to liquid when heat is removed.
- Sublimation: Direct transition from solid to gas without passing through the liquid phase.
- Deposition: Direct transition from gas to solid without passing through the liquid phase.

During a phase change, the temperature of the substance remains constant. Because the substance absorbs or releases energy as latent heat. The amount of energy required for a phase change depends on the substance and the specific process.

### Saturation temperature

At a given pressure, the temperature at which a pure substance changes phase. Denoted by $T_\text{sat}$. $ $

### Saturation Pressure
At a given temperature, the pressure at which a pure substance changes phase. Denoted by $P_\text{sat}$. $ $

## Property tables

Thermodynamic properties are often represented in the form of tables called property tables. Because they are too complex to be expressed by simple equations.

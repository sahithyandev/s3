Working fluid stays in gas phase throughout the cycle. Used in IC engines and gas turbines using the air-standard assumption.

## Air Standard Assumptions

Used to simplify real IC engine analysis.

- Working fluid = air behaving as an ideal gas.
- Air circulates in a closed loop.
- Combustion = external heat addition.
- Exhaust = heat rejection.
- All processes internally reversible.

### Cold Air Standard Assumption

$\gamma$ is assumed to be constant.

## Reciprocating Engine

An engine where a piston reciprocates (moves back and forth) inside a cylinder, and that linear motion is converted into rotary motion using a crankshaft.

### Intake Valve

A valve that opens to admit the fresh charge (air or air-fuel mixture).

### Exhaust Valve

A valve that opens to release combustion products from the cylinder during the exhaust stroke.

### Top Dead Centre

Aka. TDC. Minimum volume inside chamber.

### Bottom Dead Centre

Aka. BDC. Maximum volume inside chamber.

### Stroke

Maximum distance the piston can move. Distance between TDC and BDC.

### Displacement Volume

$ \text{Displacement Volume} = \text{Piston Area} \times \text{Stroke} $

### Clearance Volume

Volume at TDC.

### Swept Volume

Volume displaced by the piston as it moves from TDC to BDC.

### Compression Ratio

Denoted by $r$.

```math
r = \frac{V_{max}}{V_{min}}
```

### Mean Effective Pressure

Aka. MEP. A fictitious uniform pressure that gives the same net work as real cycle.

```math
\text{MEP} = \frac{w_\text{net}}{v_\text{max} - v_\text{min}}
```

## Analysis

P-V diagram is used.

### Thermal Efficiency

```math
\eta = 1 - \frac{1}{r^\gamma -1}
```

Here: $\gamma=C_p/C_v$.

Based on [the 1st law](/engineering-thermodynamics/1st-law), more specific equations are derived on a case by case basis.

### Transient state

When a thermodynamic system's state and energy transfer changes with time.

### Steady state

When a thermodynamic system's state constants with time. Net energy change in the system is zero.

## For closed systems

Net energy transfer to a closed system is equal to the net increase in the system's total energy.

```math
\begin{equation}
\nonumber
\begin{split}
\Delta Q - \Delta W & = \Delta E_{\text{sys}} = \Delta U + \Delta KE + \Delta PE \\
\Delta U & = m(h_2 - h_1) \\
\Delta KE & = \frac{1}{2}m \left(C_2^2 - C_1^2\right) \\
\Delta PE & = mg(z_2 - z_1)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
```

Here:
- $\Delta Q$ - net heat transfer to the system
- $\Delta W$ - net work transfer from the system
- $\Delta E_{\text{sys}}$ - change in total energy
- $\Delta U$ - change in internal energy
- $\Delta KE$ - change in kinetic energy
- $\Delta PE$ - change in potential energy
- $h_1, h_2$ - specific enthalpy
- $m$ - mass of the system
- $C_1, C_2$ - velocity of the system
- $g$ - gravitational acceleration
- $z_1, z_2$ - elevation of the system

## For open systems

Total specific energy of a flow system:
```math
\theta = h + \frac{1}{2}C^2 + gz
```

Here:
- $\theta$ - total specific energy
- $h = u + P\nu$ - enthalpy
- $u$ - specific internal energy
- $P\nu$ - specific flow work 
- $C$ - velocity of the flow
- $g$ - gravatitaional acceleration
- $z$ - elevation of the flow system

```math
Q - W + m_{\text{in}}\theta_{\text{in}} - m_{\text{out}}\theta_{\text{out}} = \Delta E_{\text{sys}}
```

Here:
- $Q$ - heat transfer
- $W$ - work transfer
- $m_{\text{in}}$ - mass flow rate of the inlet
- $\theta_{\text{in}}$ - total specific energy of the inlet
- $m_{\text{out}}$ - mass flow rate of the outlet
- $\theta_{\text{out}}$ - total specific energy of the outlet
- $\Delta E_{\text{sys}}$ - change in total energy of the system

### Steady Flow Energy Equation (SFEE)

Used when an open system is in steady state.

```math
q - w = h_e - h_i + \frac{1}{2}\Big(C_e^2 - C_i^2\Big) + g(z_e - z_i)
```

Here:
- $q$ - specific heat transfer
- $w$ - specific work transfer
- $h_e, h_i$ - specific enthalpy at the outlet and inlet
- $C_e, C_i$ - flow velocity at the outlet and inlet
- $g$ - gravitational acceleration
- $z_e,z_i$ - elevation at the outlet and inlet

A device that takes heat from a high-temperature source, converts part of that heat into useful work, and rejects the remaining heat to a low-temperature sink.

### Carnot Heat Engine

Aka. reversible heat engine. All processes are reversible.

All carnot engines working with the same two thermal reservoirs have the same efficiency.

```math
\frac{Q_H}{Q_L} = \frac{T_H}{T_L}
```

Here:
- $T_H$ - temperature of hot reservoir in Kelvin
- $T_L$ - temperature of cold reservoir in Kelvin
- $Q_H$ - heat taken from hot reservoir
- $Q_L$ - heat rejected to cold reservoir


### Internal Combustion Heat Engine

Combustion inside cylinder (SI, CI engines).

### External combustion

Heat supplied externally (Brayton closed cycle).

## Carnot Principle

The efficiency of a reversible heat engine operating between two thermal reservoirs is always greater than the
the efficiency of an irreversible heat engine operating between the same reservoirs.

## Reverse Heat Engine

Heat Pumps and refrigerators. Transfers heat from a cooler body to a hotter body, with the aid of work input. Reversed heat machines. Air conditioners work similarly to refrigerators.

Technically not heat engines. Opposite operation of heat engines.

| Machine      | Objective                                                               |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Heat Pump    | Heat up an environment by pumping heat into the concerned environment.  |
| Refrigerator | Cool an environment by pumping heat out from the concerned environment. |

### Coefficient of Performance

Alternative to thermal efficiency. Used in analysis of heat pumps and refrigerators. Always greater than or equal to 1.

```math
\begin{equation}
\nonumber
\begin{split}
\text{COP}_\text{heat pump} & = \frac{Q_{\text{H}}}{W_\text{in}} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{Q_L}{Q_H}} \\
\text{COP}_\text{ref} & = \frac{Q_{\text{L}}}{W_\text{in}} = \frac{1}{\frac{Q_H}{Q_L} - 1}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
```

Relationship between the 2:

```math
\text{COP}_\text{heat pump} - \text{COP}_\text{ref} = 1
```

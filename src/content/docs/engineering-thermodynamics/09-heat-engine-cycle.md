### Efficiency

```math
\text{Thermal efficiency} = \frac{W_\text{net}}{Q_\text{in}} = 1 - \frac{Q_\text{out}}{Q_\text{in}}
```

## Carnot Cycle

Ideal reversible cycle for a heat engine. Has maximum thermal efficiency.

Has 4 elements. All processes are reversible.

- through the boiler: isothermal heat addition
- through the turbine: adiabatic expansion
- through the condenser: isothermal heat rejection
- through the pump: adiabatic compression

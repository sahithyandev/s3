Empirical laws that explain the behavior of thermodynamic systems.

## 0th Law

Defines that _temperature_ is equal for 2 systems in thermal equilibrium. 

**If** 2 systems have the same temperature, **then** they are in thermal equilibrium.

**If** systems $A$ and $B$ are in thermal equilibrium **then** any system $C$ in thermal equilibrium with $A$ is also in thermal equilibrium with $B$.

:::note

[1st](/engineering-thermodynamics/1st-law) and [2nd](/engineering-thermodynamics/2nd-law) laws are explained in detail in the next pages.

## 3rd Law

As the absolute temperature approaches zero, the [entropy](/engineering-thermodynamics/entropy) of a system approaches a constant minimum value.

Establishes that it is impossible to reach absolute zero in a finite number of steps or processes. As a system approaches absolute zero, it becomes increasingly difficult to remove additional heat.

```math
\lim_{T \to 0} S = S_0
```

Here:

- $S$ is the entropy of the system
- $S_0$ is the minimum entropy value
- $T$ is the absolute temperature

:::note

$S_0=0$ for perfect crystals (an ideal solid where every atom is arranged in a completely ordered, flawless pattern with no defects).

More of an interest in statistical mechanics; and not much in engineering.

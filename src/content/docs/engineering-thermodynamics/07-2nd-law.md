Heat will not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter body. Establishes the concept of entropy (S) as a measure of the disorder or randomness in a system. It implies that natural processes tend to move toward states of higher entropy.

Entropy of an isolated system not in equilibrium will tend to increase over time, approaching a maximum value at equilibrium.

## Thermal Reservoir

Aka. heat reservoir. A body that can either absorb or release heat at constant temperature. Isothermal heat transfer device.

### Sink

A thermal reservoir that absorbs heat.

### Source

A thermal reservoir that releases heat.

## Kelvin-Planck Statement

It is impossible for any device that operates on a cycle to exchange heat with a single reservoir and produce a net amount of work. Explains the operational constraints of a [heat engine](/engineering-thermodynamics/heat-engine).

## Clausius Statement

It is impossible to construct a system which will transfer heat from a cooler body to a hotter body without work being done on the system by surrounding.

Establishes the operational constraints of [heat pumps and refrigerators](/engineering-thermodynamics/heat-engine#reverse-heat-engine).
